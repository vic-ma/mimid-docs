# What is Mimid?

Mimid is a music player designed for learning songs by ear.
Mimid runs in your browser, and it's designed for mobile devices.

# Existing solutions

Standard music players like Spotify and Apple Music are hard to use for learning songs.
That's because they don't come with any skip controls or speed controls or loop controls.

YouTube is bit better, because it does have skip controls and speed controls.
But it's still not great, since the smallest amount you can skip by is five seconds,
and it takes eight taps just to change the speed.

Finally, there are music players that are designed specifically for learning songs by ear.
But these often don't have the best UI.
They also require you to supply your own music files.
