# Why Mimid?

## The problem

Standard music players like Spotify and Apple Music are bad for learning songs by ear.
That's because they don't have any way of skipping back a couple of seconds (without using the seekbar),
and they don't have any way of changing the playback speed.
Learning songs by ear is much harder without these two things.

YouTube is a bit better, because it does have skip controls and speed controls.
But it still has problems that make it frustrating to use.
For example, the smallest amount you can skip by is five seconds,
and it takes four taps just to change the speed.

Finally, there are music players that are designed specifically for learning songs by ear.
These are often better than YouTubeâ€”but they're still not great.
The buttons are often too small, or the speed controls might use a slider, or they might just be plain ugly.
They also require you to supply your own music files, which you might not have.

## The solution

Mimid was designed with one goal in mind:
to have the best controls possible for learning songs by ear.

That's why all the buttons are large and easy-to-press.
That's also why it takes just one tap to slow down a song or speed it back up.
And that's also why the player auto-resumes when you skip forward or backward, or when you change the speed.

Mimid lets you focus on learning songs instead of fighting your music player.

## Why not Mimid?

Mimid is designed for casual use.
So Mimid doesn't come with any advanced features like isolating different instruments with AI,
or analyzing the chords that are being played, or even changing the pitch of a song.

If you need features beyond simple playback control, then Mimid is likely not the right tool for you.
