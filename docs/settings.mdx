## Auto-paste Video URL

**Allow Mimid to automatically load videos URLs you have copied.**
This removes the need to manually paste video URLs into the URL bar.

## Scale Skips by Speed

**Scale skip amounts based on the current speed.**
This makes the amount that you skip by represent real time, and not player time.

So if you skip five seconds at normal speed, the player still skips five seconds. ($5 s * 1 = 5 s$)

## Skip Back Auto-Pause

**Automatically pause after you return to the place you skipped from.**

After you skip backward and wait for the player to return to the place you skipped from, Mimid will automatically pause the player.

This can be useful if you find yourself frequently pausing after you skip backward, and you'd rather have Mimid do it automatically.

:::tip

The timer mechanism behind this setting work isn't entirely accurate. So this setting works better for longer backward jumps, like five seconds.
