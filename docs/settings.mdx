## Auto-paste Video URL

**Mimid will automatically load video URLs you have copied.**

This removes the need to manually paste video URLs into the URL bar.

## Scale Skips by Speed

**Scale skip amounts based on the current player speed.**

This makes the number on the skip buttons represent real time, and not player time.
This may make the skip buttons feel more natural to you.

:::info
For reference, the YouTube website scales skips by speed, while the YouTube mobile app does not.

## Skip Back Auto-Pause

**Automatically pause after you skip backward and return to where you skipped from.**

After you skip backward and the player plays until it returns to where you skipped from, the player will automatically pause.

This can be useful if you often skip backward, let the song play, and then press pause before you try it on your instrument.
With this setting enabled, you don't have to press pause manually.

## Slow Speed

**Set the speed to use when the Slow Speed Button is on.**

## Delay Between Loops

**Set the amount of time to pause for before a loop repeats itself.**

This can be useful if you want some silence in between loops, in order to try the thing you just heard.

## Skip Backward Long

**Set the amount of time that the Skip Backward Long Button skips.**

## Skip Backward Short

**Set the amount of time that the Skip Backward Short Button skips.**

## Skip Forward Short

**Set the amount of time that the Skip Forward Short Button skips.**

## Skip Forward Long

**Set the amount of time that the Skip Forward Long Button skips.**

## Controls Offset

**Push the controls lower on the screen.**

This can be useful if you have a taller phone and want the controls to be closer to the bottom, for example.

## Controls

**These settings change Mimid's controls layout.**

The controls layout is represented by a grid.

<img
  src={ControlsWithGridlines}
  width="400px"
  alt="Mimid controls with overlaid gridlines"
/>

Each cell in the grid is either a button, or it is empty.
Multiple cells of the same button form a bigger button.

Buttons can only be rectangular in shape, and you can't have more than one of the same button.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Play Button**</td>
      <td>**Play Button**</td>
      <td>**Play Button**</td>
