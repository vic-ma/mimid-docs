## Auto-paste video URL

_Automatically load video if you have a video URL copied._

This removes the need to manually paste video URLs into the URL bar.

## Scale skips by speed

_Scale skip amounts based on the current player speed._

This makes the number on the skip buttons represent the amount of real time skipped, and not player time.
This might make the skip buttons feel more natural to you.

:::info
For reference, the YouTube website scales skips by speed, while the YouTube app does not.
:::

## Skip back auto-pause

_After you skip backward and return to where you skipped from, automatically pause._

After you skip backward and the player plays until it returns to where you skipped from, the player automatically pauses.

This can be useful if you often find yourself skipping backward, letting the song play,
and then tapping pause before you play on your instrument.
With this setting enabled, you don't have to tap pause manually.

:::info
The auto-pause feature actually just uses a simple timer.
So the pause happens whether or not you return to where you skipped from.
:::

## Slow speed

_Set the speed to use when the slow speed is enabled._

## Delay between loops

_Set the amount of time to pause before a loop repeats._

This can be useful if you want some silence in between loops,
in order to play the thing you just heard.

## Skip buttons

_Set the skip amount for each skip button._

## Controls offset

_Push the controls lower on the screen._

This can be useful if you have a taller phone and want the controls to be closer to the bottom, for example.

## Controls

_Change Mimid's control layout._

You change Mimid's control layout by changing the _control layout grid._

The cells in this grid are each set to a button (or are left empty).
This determines which buttons appear where, in Mimid.
For example, let's say you set the top-left cell of the grid to the Play Button.
Then, the Play Button will appear in the top-left corner of the controls.

If you set multiple adjacent cells to the same button, that will create a bigger button.

:::info
Multiple cells of the same button must form a rectangular area.
So you can't have something like an L-shaped button.
You also can't have more than one of each button.
:::

This image shows the control layout grid on top of the default controls.

<img

And here's what the default control layout grid looks like.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Play Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Play Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Play Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Play Button**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Loop Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Loop Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Speed Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Speed Button**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Skip Backward Long Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Skip Backward Short Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Skip Forward Short Button**</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>**Skip Forward Long Button**</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Rows and columns

_Set the number of rows and columns in the controls grid._

You can change the number of rows and columns in the grid in order to get the exact size of buttons that you want.
For example, let's say you want the Play Button to take up the top 30% of the controls.
Then, you would set the number of rows to 10, and set the cells in the first three rows to the Play Button.

:::info
The number of rows and columns does not change the actual size of the controls.
It just gives you more freedom over the size of the buttons _within_ the controls.
:::

### Grid

_Set the cells of the controls grid._

:::tip
To set multiple cells to the same button,
you only need to set the top-left and bottom-right cells of the area you want.
Mimid will automatically fill in everything in between.
:::

## Theme

_Set Mimid's color._

## Dark mode

_Enable dark mode._
