## Auto-paste Video URL

**Mimid will automatically load video URLs you have copied.**

This removes the need to manually paste video URLs into the URL bar.

## Scale Skips by Speed

**Scale skip amounts based on the current player speed.**

This makes the number on the skip buttons represent real time, and not player time.
This may make the skip buttons feel more natural to you.

:::info
For reference, the YouTube website scales skips by speed, while the YouTube mobile app does not.

## Skip Back Auto-Pause

**Automatically pause after you skip backward and return to where you skipped from.**

After you skip backward and the player plays until it returns to where you skipped from, the player will automatically pause.

This can be useful if you often skip backward, let the song play, and then press pause before you try it on your instrument.
With this setting enabled, you don't have to press pause manually.

## Slow Speed

**Set the speed to use when the Slow Speed Button is on.**

## Delay Between Loops

**Set the amount of time to pause for before a loop repeats itself.**

This can be useful if you want some silence in between loops, in order to try the thing you just heard.

## Skip Backward Short

**Set the amount of time that the Skip Backward Short Button skips.**
