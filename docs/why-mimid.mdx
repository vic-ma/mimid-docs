# Why Mimid?

## The problem

Standard music players like Spotify and Apple Music aren't great for learning songs by ear.
That's because they don't have any way of skipping back a couple of seconds (without using the seekbar),
and they don't have any way of changing the playback speed.
Learning songs by ear is much harder without these two things.

YouTube is a bit better, because it does have skip controls and speed controls.
But it's still frustrating to use, because YouTube isn't designed for learning songs by ear.
So you run into some problems when you do try to use it for that purpose.
For example, the smallest amount you can skip by is five seconds,
and it takes eight taps just to change the speed in the YouTube app.

Finally, there are music players that are designed specifically for learning songs by ear.
These are often easier to use than YouTubeâ€”but they're still not great.
The buttons are often too small, or the speed controls may use a slider, or they may just be plain ugly.
They also all require you to supply your own music files, which you may not have.

## The importance of controls

Great controls are essential in a music player designed for learning songs by ear.
When you're learning a song, you might hear a note,
pause, try playing it on your instrument, not get it correct,
skip backward, change the speed, resume, pause, try it on your instrument,
reset the speed, and then resume.

When you're performing this many different actions,
all while switching back and forth between your instrument and your phone,
any small delay caused by a bad UI adds up.
That's why it's essential for your music player to have a UI that's as easy to use as possible.

## Why Mimid?

Mimid was designed with one goal in mind: make a music player for musicians with the best controls possible.

That's why all the buttons are large and easy to press.
That's also why it takes just one tap to slow down a song or speed it back up.
And that's also why the player auto-resumes when you skip forward or backward, or when you change the speed.

Mimid lets you focus on learning your song rather than fighting your music player.

## Why not Mimid?

Mimid is lightweight and designed for casual use.

So Mimid doesn't come with any advanced features like isolating different instruments with AI,
or analyzing the chords that are being played, or even just changing the pitch of a song.

If you need features beyond simple playback control, then you should not use Mimid.
