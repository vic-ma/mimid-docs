# Why Mimid?

## The problem

Standard music players like Spotify and Apple Music are hard to learn songs with.
That's because they don't come with any skip controls or speed controls,
which are invaluable when learning songs by ear.

YouTube is better, because it does have skip controls and speed controls.
But it can still be frustrating to use, because the smallest amount you can skip by is five seconds,
and it takes eight taps just to change the speed.

Finally, there are music players that are designed specifically for learning songs by ear.
These are often better than YouTube, but their UIs are still suboptimal.
The buttons may be too small, or the speed controls may use a slider, or they may just be plain ugly.
They also all require you to supply your own music files, which can be a pain.

## The importance of UI

Great controls are essential for learning songs by ear.
When you're learning a song, you might hear a note,
pause, try playing it on your instrument, not get it correct,
skip backward, change the speed, resume, pause, try it on your instrument,
reset the speed, and then resume.

When you're performing this many different actions,
all while switching back and forth between your instrument and your phone,
any small delay caused by a bad UI adds up.
That's why it's crucial for your music player to have a UI that's as easy to use as possible.

## Why Mimid

Mimid was designed with a focus on great controls.

That's why all the buttons are large and easy to press.
That's also why it takes just one tap to slow down a song or speed it back up.
And that's also why the player auto-resumes when you skip forward or backward, or when you change the speed.

Mimid lets you focus on learning your song rather than fighting your music player.
