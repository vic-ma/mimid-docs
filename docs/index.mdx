# What is Mimid?

Mimid is a music player designed for learning songs by ear.
Mimid runs in your browser, and it's designed for mobile devices.

# Existing solutions

Standard music players like Spotify and Apple Music are hard to learn songs with.
That's because they don't come with any skip controls or speed controls,
which are invaluable when learning songs by ear.

YouTube is better, because it does have skip controls and speed controls.
But it can still be frustrating to use, because the smallest amount you can skip by is five seconds,
and it takes eight taps just to change the speed.

Finally, there are music players that are designed specifically for learning songs by ear.
These are often better than YouTube, but they still have their flaws.
For example, the buttons may be small and hard to press, or they may use a slider to change the speed.
They also all require you to supply your own music files, which can be a pain, if you use music streaming service.
