# What is Mimid?

Mimid is a music player designed for learning songs by ear.
Mimid is designed for mobile devices.

# Why use Mimid?

Standard music players like Spotify and Apple Music are hard to use for learning songs.
They don't come with any skip controls or speed controls or loop controls.

YouTube is better, because it does have skip controls and speed controls.
But it's still not great, because the smallest amount you can skip by is five seconds,
which is often longer than you need.
It also takes eight taps just to change the speed.
